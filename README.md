An e-learning website using Azure SQL database with .NET Core C#, created by following these steps:
1.	Project Setup:
−	Create a new ASP.NET Core Web Application project in Visual Studio.
−	Choose the MVC template based on requirements.
2.	Database Configuration:
−	Set up Azure SQL database and creating the password for the connectivity and security.
−	Define database schema, including tables for users (Students, Administrators), courses, Modules, quizzes.
−	Configure the connection string in the appsettings.json file to connect application to the SQL database.
3.	User Authentication and Authorization:
−	Implement user authentication and authorization using ASP.NET packages.
−	Password hashing to avoid and prevent cybercriminals from stealing information.
−	Define user roles and permissions to manage access levels for different features of the e-learning platform (Student and administrators).
4.	Course Management:
−	Create functionalities to manage courses, including creation, editing, deletion, and enrollment (CRUD Operations).
−	Design database models and controllers to handle CRUD operations for courses.
5.	Content Management:
−	Develop features to manage course content such as modules and tasks.
−	Implement functionality for instructors to create and manage course materials (Administrator).
6.	Learning Experience:
−	Design user interfaces for learners to browse and search for courses to enrol.
−	 Implement features for students to track their progress within courses and make tasks.
7.	Assessment and Feedback:
−	Create mechanisms for managing tasks within courses.
8.	Certification and Badges:
−	Implement functionalities to issue certificates and badges upon course completion or achievement of milestones.
9.	Account Management:
−	Develop user account management features such as getting started at a course, two-factor authentication (2FA) and email verification, etc.
10.	Administrative Functions:
−	Create administrative panels for managing users, courses, content, and other aspects of the platform.
11.	Testing and Deployment:
−	Test the application thoroughly to ensure functionality, security, and performance.
−	Deploy the e-learning website to a hosting environment using Microsoft Azure service to implement penetration testing.

These steps have built a robust e-learning website using .NET Core C# and Azure SQL Database, providing users with a comprehensive learning experience.
